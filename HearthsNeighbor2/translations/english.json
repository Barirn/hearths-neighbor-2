        "$HN2MagiEye2": "I spoke with it, and it did not have any answers for me. It simply told me its purpose: to end all, that all might be born anew. Despite the tone some might interpret as sinister, it bears no ill will. Like...a decomposer, it serves a critical role in recycling death, so that more life may rise from the dead.",

A young creature had been stranded there in his escape pod, and with his lack of survival skills, he would have surely died of starvation, or worse.",
        "$HN2MagiFox2": "I rescued him, of course, but when I asked him where he his home was so I could take him back, he said he had none. His kind had killed themselves off in a war, and he was the sole survivor of his race. His own planet was no longer even fit to live on. With that, he broke down sobbing.",
        "$HN2MagiFox3": "When he recovered, I offered him board, in return for his assistance. I had a plan to counter the Lie, and for that I would need to build a Device. However, this Device was based on connections, on community, and in order for it to function, I would need the collaboration of many others.",

        "$HN2MagiLife3": "Fortunately, I have a solution. An Immortality Crystal, installed as part of the Device, and completely preventing aging. It will not work for our ultimate goal, but it should allow anyone on this ship to survive long enough to see the day it is reached.",

        "$HN2MagiOwlk3": "It took some convincing, as she was understandably quite scared of the idea, but when I turned to leave, she changed her mind. It seemed that her fear of the unknown was overcome by her desire to see the cosmos she had studied all her life.",
        "$HN2MagiOwlk4": "On the ship, we talked about her and her kind. The name for their race roughly translates to \"Inhabitants\", but Vultos, spooked by her when she first arrived, wanted to call her \"Ghost Bird.\". She's not really a fan of the nickname, though.

        "$HN2MagiNomai2": "Like Vespa, she was an inventor, and she had created a Warp Core Anti-Distortion Safeguard. This component, meant to be equipped to their Vessels, would essentially \"ping\" the area a Vessel is attempting to warp to and check for distorted space. If such space was found, it would modify the warp coordinates slightly to prevent a potential disaster.",
        "$HN2MagiNomai3": "She planned to present this at a Festival, but her clan laughed at the idea. Distorted space was an unproven concept and the component was quite expensive to create. In a fit of anger, she used an Escape Pod in an attempt to get as far from her clan as possible.",
