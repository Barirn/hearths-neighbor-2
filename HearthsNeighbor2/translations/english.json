        "$HN2Chamber4": "LILY: I don't think any of us had anticipated that the Magister's message would completely change our life like this.",
        "$HN2Chamber5": "ROJA: It is certainly a strange feeling, I had no doubts in our Magister's ability, but it feels strange to know zat zis will all be over soon.",
        "$HN2Chamber6": "VESPA: To travel new worlds, new universes, I have to admit, I am a little nervous about the whole prospect.",
        "$HN2Chamber7": "ACQUARIUS: Aye, the feeling's understandable mate. The unknown is...scary. But exploring the unknown is what yer good at. You'll do great out there.",

        "$HN2Camp2": "QUARTZ: You sure it's ok for me to set one up in here?",
        "$HN2Camp3": "VESPA: Don't worry, I set up filters for the smoke, indoor campfires are a common thing for my kind.",
        "$HN2Camp4": "ACQUARIUS: 'Aight, lemme see these \"marshmallows\" you keep raving about.",
        "$HN2Camp5": "QUARTZ: Of course! Here, you can eat one raw...yes, I know, their gooey flavor is the best thing in the universe. But watch this, you put it on a stick, roast it on the fire for a minute, and...\neven better, a roasted marshmallow!",
        "$HN2Camp6": "ROJA: Mmm, delicious!",
        "$HN2Camp7": "MAGISTER: Yes, quite, the flavor is...something. But I believe it's incomplete...",
        "$HN2Camp8": "QUARTZ: What? You dare insult the Hearthian Magnum Opus?",
        "$HN2Camp9": "MAGISTER: Oh, I would not dream of it. It is quite a flavor, even on it's own. But, perhaps with the several of us here, the flavor can be enhanced. Lily, do you have any of those honey crackers?",
        "$HN2Camp10": "LILY: Of course, Magister, here, I have a pack right now.",
        "$HN2Camp11": "MAGISTER: Wonderful! And Acquarius, do you have any chocolate?",
        "$HN2Camp12": "ACQUARIUS: Salted or unsalted, I got 'em both.",
        "$HN2Camp13": "MAGISTER: I'd like to try with the unsalted first. Break off a square, put it a cracker, then stick on a perfectly roasted marshmallow to melt it, and...top it with another cracker. Down the hatch...it is delicious!",
        "$HN2Camp14": "ACQUARIUS: 'ere, lemme try, MMMMMM!",
        "$HN2Camp15": "QUARTZ: Huh, had my doubts, but you're right, this is so good!",

        // Foxle Dorm
        "$HN2FoxleCube1": "VULTOS: Here is my room. It's not much, but our kind do have a thing for minimalism.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube2": "QUARTZ: Ah, it's quite nice. You know, we don't really need much either. Just some boards, connected with sap and duct tape.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube3": "VULTOS: It must be nice, such a simple life. Sleeping under the stars, eating marshmallows, and taking each day at a time without a care in the world.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube4": "QUARTZ: Yeah, but can't say I'm not looking forward to something brand new, even if it is a lot more complex.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube5": "QUARTZ: By the way, what's your story Vultos? You've been here the longest, right?",
        "$HN2FoxleCube6": "VULTOS: Well, not quite, the Magister was here first. No one really knows his story. But, he did find me and rescue me. My escape pod landed on an uninhabited planet, and I lacked the skills for survival. I would have died, if he hadn't found me and brought me on board.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube7": "QUARTZ: And it was then he presented you the idea for the Device, right? I admit, I still find the whole idea a little weird.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube8": "VULTOS: It's undertandable to doubt our goal here. But it's for the good of all. We must ensure this universe does not truly die.",

        // Foxle Dorm Secret
        "$HN2FoxleSecret1": "VULTOS: It's really been 200 years since that day, huh. 200 years since...I ran like a coward.",
        "$HN2FoxleSecret2": "VULTOS: The Magister and Vespa always try to console me, and I know they're right. Had I stayed, I'd have died with the rest of them.",
        "$HN2FoxleSecret3": "VULTOS: Still, that doesn't make it hurt any less. The idea that...I didn't deserve to be rescued. I should have died on that green planet, fallen into one of the geysers and drowned.",
        "$HN2FoxleSecret4": "VULTOS: I hope that...",
        "$HN2FoxleSecret5": "VULTOS: I should get back to work on my schematics.",

        "$HN2OwlkCube2": "VULTOS: Ha, you bet! I'll win one of these days!",
        "$HN2OwlkCube3": "ACQUARIUS: Methinks that maybe ya should give up, you haven't won a game in nearly two hundred years!",
        "$HN2OwlkCube4": "VESPA: Quitters never prosper, Acquarius.",
        "$HN2OwlkCube5": "ACQUARIUS: Back where I come from, 'tis considered wisdom to know when to stop. I'd have shocked myself to death long ago if I simply kept banging me head against me problems. Vul, 'ow about taking a break, ya? I know yer in a hurry to win, but patience is a virtue.",

        // Owlk Dorm Upper
        "$HN2OwlkCube2-1": "VESPA: Are you alright? I've never used a Vision Torch on another race...",
        "$HN2OwlkCube2-2": "MAGISTER: No, I, I am all right. This technology is quite unique. Projection is a key function the Device needs.",
        "$HN2OwlkCube2-3": "VESPA: Would you like to try it? Here, you should be able to use the Torch...",
        "$HN2OwlkCube2-4": "MAGISTER: No, thank you, I've gathered all the data I need from it already.",
        "$HN2OwlkCube2-5": "VESPA: ...all right.",

        "$HN2NomaiCube1": "QUARTZ: Wow, I've seen Nomai stuff before, but never so...fresh and clean.",
        "$HN2NomaiCube2": "LILY: You've met Nomai before?",
        "$HN2NomaiCube3": "QUARTZ: I wish, but all the Nomai my kind have found have died long ago. There are plenty of ruins of theirs, but we have no idea what happened to them. Their building are all abandoned.",
        "$HN2NomaiCube4": "LILY: ...oh.",
        "$HN2NomaiCube5": "QUARTZ: Oh, sorry, I, I didn't think about it. I mean, I'm sure there are more Nomai out there...",
        "$HN2NomaiCube6": "LILY: Oh, no, don't let me be a downer! Come on, you still have many others to meet! And we've got to brainstorm what tech you can to the Device.",

        "$HN2RedeyeCube2": "VULTOS: This is quite a garden you've got here. I guess you have a lot of experience with plants?",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube3": "ROJA: Oh! I did not see you zere! Yes, I am a master gardener. It was my main hobby back home, and quite valueable of a profession.",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube4": "VULTOS: Oh, really, why is that?",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube5": "ROJA: Oh, well you see, my kind is extremely colorblind. Many colors appear off to us. As we are an herbivorous species, being able to determine what a plant was with our far more limited ability to really see zem was an invaluable skill",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube6": "VULTOS: I see. Well, I'm glad you have a hobby you enjoy so much, and you're able to be a big help to your kind.",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube7": "ROJA: Zank you for ze kind vords!",

        "$HN2EntranceWall2": "LILY: This tech is quite advanced, though. The cube here that greeted me decoded my language when I arrived, perhaps reading it from my memory?",
        "$HN2EntranceWall3": "LILY: Hopefully my talents will actually be appreciated here.",

        "$HN2CampWall1": "LILY: It took some looking for resources, but I've managed to install a special gravity crystal here.",
        "$HN2CampWall2": "LILY: It projects a special kind of gravity field in the whole room, producing lighter gravity than this vessel's average further from it, and heavier gravity near it.",
        "$HN2CampWall3": "LILY: And as is typical for a crystal, it requires no power, so should something happen to this vessel's gravity, we can retreat to this room.",
        "$HN2CampWall4": "LILY: This should be able to satisfy the various gravity requirements for us, so we can all relax in comfort.",

        "$HN2HomeWall1_4": "LILY: It's always quite a sight to see the Magister at work, and just manipulate the shape of the this Vessel at will.",

        "$HN2HomeWall2_2": "LILY: Only Vespa's room really even compares, to be honest. The others are quite...flat.",
        "$HN2HomeWall2_3": "LILY: I admit, surrounded by familiar architecture, I am beginning to miss home. But, I know that they probably aren't missing me. And, I'm part of something much bigger here, anyway."
