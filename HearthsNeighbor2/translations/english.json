        "$HN2Camp5": "QUARTZ: Of course! Here, you can eat one raw...yes, I know, their gooey flavor is the best thing in the universe. But watch this, you put it on a stick, roast it on the fire for a minute, and...\neven better, a roasted marshmallow!",

        "$HN2Camp7": "MAGISTER: Yes, quite, the flavor is...something. But I believe it's incomplete...",
        "$HN2Camp8": "QUARTZ: What? You dare insult the Hearthian Magnum Opus?",
        "$HN2Camp9": "MAGISTER: Oh, I would not dream of it. It is quite a flavor, even on it's own. But, perhaps with the several of us here, the flavor can be enhanced. Lily, do you have any of those honey crackers?",
        "$HN2Camp10": "LILY: Of course, Magister, here, I have a pack right now.",

        "$HN2Camp13": "MAGISTER: I'd like to try with the unsalted first. Break off a square, put it a cracker, then stick on a perfectly roasted marshmallow to melt it, and...top it with another cracker. Down the hatch...it is delicious!",

        "$HN2FoxleCube1": "VULTOS: Here is my room. It's not much, but our kind do have a thing for minimalism.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube2": "QUARTZ: Ah, it's quite nice. You know, we don't really need much either. Just some boards, connected with sap and duct tape.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube3": "VULTOS: It must be nice, such a simple life. Sleeping under the stars, eating marshmallows, and taking each day at a time without a care in the world.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube4": "QUARTZ: Yeah, but can't say I'm not looking forward to something brand new, even if it is a lot more complex.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube5": "QUARTZ: By the way, what's your story Vultos? You've been here the longest, right?",
        "$HN2FoxleCube6": "VULTOS: Well, not quite, the Magister was here first. No one really knows his story. But, he did find me and rescue me. My escape pod landed on an uninhabited planet, and I lacked the skills for survival. I would have died, if he hadn't found me and brought me on board.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube7": "QUARTZ: And it was then he presented you the idea for the Device, right? I admit, I still find the whole idea a little weird.",
        "$HN2FoxleCube8": "VULTOS: It's undertandable to doubt our goal here. But it's for the good of all. We must ensure this universe does not truly die.",

        "$HN2FoxleSecret2": "VULTOS: The Magister and Vespa always try to console me, and I know they're right. Had I stayed, I'd have died with the rest of them.",
        "$HN2FoxleSecret3": "VULTOS: Still, that doesn't make it hurt any less. The idea that...I didn't deserve to be rescued. I should have died on that green planet, fallen into one of the geysers and drowned.",

        "$HN2OwlkCube5": "ACQUARIUS: Back where I come from, 'tis considered wisdom to know when to stop. I'd have shocked myself to death long ago if I simply kept banging me head against me problems. Vul, 'ow about taking a break, ya? I know yer in a hurry to win, but patience is a virtue.",

        "$HN2OwlkCube2-2": "MAGISTER: No, I, I am all right. This technology is quite unique. Projection is a key function the Device needs.",

        "$HN2NomaiCube2": "LILY: You've met Nomai before?",
        "$HN2NomaiCube3": "QUARTZ: I wish, but all the Nomai my kind have found have died long ago. There are plenty of ruins of theirs, but we have no idea what happened to them. Their building are all abandoned.",
        "$HN2NomaiCube4": "LILY: ...oh.",
        "$HN2NomaiCube5": "QUARTZ: Oh, sorry, I, I didn't think about it. I mean, I'm sure there are more Nomai out there...",
        "$HN2NomaiCube6": "LILY: Oh, no, don't let me be a downer! Come on, you still have many others to meet! And we've got to brainstorm what tech you can to the Device.",

        "$HN2RedeyeCube3": "ROJA: Oh! I did not see you zere! Yes, I am a master gardener. It was my main hobby back home, and quite valueable of a profession.",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube4": "VULTOS: Oh, really, why is that?",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube5": "ROJA: Oh, well you see, my kind is extremely colorblind. Many colors appear off to us. As we are an herbivorous species, being able to determine what a plant was with our far more limited ability to really see zem was an invaluable skill",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube6": "VULTOS: I see. Well, I'm glad you have a hobby you enjoy so much, and you're able to be a big help to your kind.",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube7": "ROJA: Zank you for ze kind vords!",
        "$HN2RedeyeCube8": "VULTOS: Brightening up other people's days is my calling.",

        "$HN2HearthCube1": "ROJA: Are you sure it is wise to leave a can of flammable liquid in a room made of wood?",
        "$HN2HearthCube2": "QUARTZ: Hmm? Why wouldn't it be? I'll be careful.",
        "$HN2HearthCube3": "ROJA: Yes, just like you were careful to not fall in zat geyser.",
        "$HN2HearthCube4": "QUARTZ: Well, it turned out all right, didn't it? Had I not, I'd never have met you guys!",
        "$HN2HearthCube5": "ROJA: Zat is true...just promise me zat you won't cause a fire. I'd hate for something to happen to you, or my plants next door.",
        "$HN2HearthCube6": "QUARTZ: Of course! I shall do my best to ensure this is maintained responsibly.",
        "$HN2HearthCube7": "ROJA: Zank you. By the vay, vy do you even have it?",
        "$HN2HearthCube8": "QUARTZ: It's a special blend of flammable tree sap. I figure, if there's anything I can contribute to the device, it's the Hearthian special fuel.",

        // Magister Dorm Cubes
        "$HN2MagiKirmby1": "I found this figure at a gift shop in some forgotten land. There were several of this character in various configurations, and they almost all looked...adorable.",
        "$HN2MagiKirmby2": "But this one, this one...something about it just...fills me with a sense of ANGER and MALICE. As if...the only thing I want when I look at it is to BAN it from existance.",
        "$HN2MagiKirmby3": "Perhaps it was unwise to obtain something that effects me so negatively, but I am just so...intrigued by it.",

        "$HN2MagiStart1": "I woke up in this mysterious vessel...I do not know who I am...what I am...or why I am here.",
        "$HN2MagiStart2": "What I do know...this ship is mine, it responds to my desires, and I have a myriad of these strange cubes that appear to record memories and play them at will...",
        "$HN2MagiStart3": "And...I do not believe I have amnesia. I was...created here. This ship, created for me. But by whom?",
        "$HN2MagiStart4": "Well, there is a whole universe out there for me to explore...the answer must be out there somewhere.",

        "$HN2MagiEye1": "Today I found something...universe shaking. A vortex, a power older than the universe, and I feel some...kinship, with it.",
        "$HN2MagiEye2": "I spoke with it, and it did not have any answers for me. It simply told me its purpose: to end all, that all might be born anew. Despite the tone some might interpret as sinister, it bears no ill will. Like...a decomposer, it serves a critical role in recycling death, so that more life may rise from the dead.",
        "$HN2MagiEye3": "But, must all end? True, this universe has a limited lifespan, but what if, what if we were not bound by this universe?",
        "$HN2MagiEye4": "The idea that all must end...that is the Lie of the Universe...there must be a way to preserve the life of this universe beyond.",

        "$HN2MagiFox1": "As I was doing my centurial trip to the vortex to see if there had been any new developments, I received a distress signal from a nearby planet. A young creature had been stranded there in his escape pod, and with his lack of survival skills, he would surely die of starvation, or worse.",
        "$HN2MagiFox2": "I rescued him, of course, but when I asked him where he his home was so I could take him back, he said he had none. His kind had killed themselves off in a war, and he was the sole survivor of his race. His own planet was no longer even fit to live on. With that, he broke down sobbing.",
        "$HN2MagiFox3": "When he recovered, I offered him board, in return for his assistance. I had a plan to counter the Lie, and for that I would need to build a Device. However, this Device was based on connections, on community, and in order to function, I would need the collaboration of many others.",
        "$HN2MagiFox4": "Without hesitation, he agreed. I created a room for him, and we exchanged more information about each other. His name is Vultos. And my name is...my name...I...I told him that I am the Magister.",

        "$HN2MagiLife1": "I have encountered a major problem. I am immortal, and while the idea that a being would have a limited lifespawn is a known fact to me, it has just not occurred to me just how short a life is.",
        "$HN2MagiLife2": "Vultos is ageing quite rapidly, and while he has been an invaluable asset in the creation of the Device, he will not live nearly long enough to see it be fired.",
        "$HN2MagiLife3": "Fortunately, I have a solution. An Immortality Crystal, installed as part of the Device, and completely preventing aging. It will not work for our ultimate goal, but it should allow anyone on this ship to survive long enough to see the day it is reached.",

        "$HN2MagiOwlk1": "I passed by an inhabited moon, and in disguise I visited the population in search of someone who would be willing to work on the Device. The beings here are bird-like, with antlers.",
        "$HN2MagiOwlk2": "I was recommended the house of one of them who was a young inventor, Vespa. She had created a telescope powered by flame, capable of detecting signals from space.",
        "$HN2MagiOwlk3": "It took some convincing, as she was understandably quite scared of the idea, but when I turned to leaved, she changed her mind. It seemed that her fear of the unknown was overcome by her desire to see the cosmos she studied all her life.",
        "$HN2MagiOwlk4": "On the ship, we talked about her and her kind. The name for their race roughly translates to \"Inhabitants\", but Vultos, spooked by her when she first arrived, wanted to call her \"Ghost Bird.\". She's not really a fan of the nickname, though. Considering that she seems to be the a mix of an owl and an elk, I've presented the idea O-[REMAINING RECORDING CORRUPTED]",

        "$HN2MagiPiscen1": "Today we crashed into an ocean planet. There was a malfunction with the engines and it was unable to counter the massive gravity when we tried to park.",
        "$HN2MagiPiscen2": "Fortunately, this planet is occupied by a friendly race of semiaquatic four-armed shark people, and one of them was kind enough to come aboard and try to fix the engines.",
        "$HN2MagiPiscen3": "He's an electrical engineer named Acquarius, and he's quite friendly despite how initimidating he is to poor old Vultos. He's even taller than Vespa, though of course no where near my true stature.",
        "$HN2MagiPiscen4": "He was absolutely fascinated by all the equipment on our ship, and he actually asked to join our crew. Well, welcome aboard.",

        "$HN2MagiNomai1": "I came across yet another escape pod today, this time Nomai in origin. Despite the massive capacity, there was only one member on board, by the name of Lily.",
        "$HN2MagiNomai2": "Like Vespa, she was an inventor, and she had created a Warp Core Anti-Distortion Safeguard. This component, meant to be equipped to their Vessels, would essentially \"ping\" the area the Vessel is attempting to warp to and check for distorted space. If such space was found, it would modify the warp coordinates slightly to prevent a potential disaster.",
        "$HN2MagiNomai3": "She planned to present this at a Festival, but her clan laughed at the idea. Distorted space was an unproven concept and the component was pretty expensive to create. In a fit of anger, she used an Escape Pod in an attempt to get as far from her clan as possible.",
        "$HN2MagiNomai4": "I, however, was very interested in her tech and theories, and welcomed her aboard.",

        "$HN2MagiRedeye1": "Roja. Botanist and fashion geru. Why did I let her on board?",
        "$HN2MagiRedeye2": "Do not get me wrong, I am happy to have a new member on our crew, but she is so...mischeivous. I fear that she is one day going to poke around in this ship where she does not belong.",
        "$HN2MagiRedeye3": "Sigh...I am sure she will calm herself in time.",

        "$HN2MagiHearthian1": "Our deadline approaches. The Device is nearly complete, but we need one more component. I went to visit the vortex again, but on a nearby planet, I caught sight of a local Hearthian who had accidentally launched themself into space via a geyser.",
        "$HN2MagiHearthian2": "They haven't even discovered space flight yet, but...well, I need help. Maybe this one, named Quartz, will provide the last component we need.",
