VULTOS LINES: 37
Vultos is the last surviving member of the Foxle race from Hearth's Neighbor. He speaks quickly and has a higher-pitched voice, but can drop to a calmer, more down-to-earth voice when he's more serious or depressed.

"$HN2Chamber1": "VULTOS: The Device is nearly ready, Magister."
"$HN2LibrarySecret2": "VULTOS: Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure."
"$HN2LibrarySecret4": "VULTOS: Oh, um, sure, thanks."
"$HN2LibrarySecret6": "VULTOS: Look, I told you already, I'm not... I'm not ready to discuss that."
"$HN2LibrarySecret8": "VULTOS: Let's just focus on the Device. I've got a schematic written up, but I think I've hit a problem. The Device will have difficulty actually affecting someone with space protection."
"$HN2LibrarySecret10": "VULTOS: Hmm, yes, of course. I'll make sure to set the Device so that it doesn't even try to fire if you are wearing too much for it."
"$HN2LibraryLamp2": "VULTOS: AH! Roja! This is supposed to be my secret spot!",
"$HN2LibraryLamp3": "VULTOS: ...are you...hypnotized?",
"$HN2LibraryLamp4": "VULTOS: ...moths are <![CDATA[<i>weird</i>]]>."
"$HN2LibraryMagi3": "VULTOS: I've always just assumed he was some kind of cosmic horror, to be honest."
"$HN2LibraryMagi8": "VULTOS: ...cosmic horror it is, I guess."
"$HN2Camp1": "VULTOS: Well, it seems that campfires are a constant of the universe."
"$HN2FoxleCube1": "VULTOS: Here is my room. It's not much, but our kind do have a thing for minimalism."
"$HN2FoxleCube3": "VULTOS: It must be nice, such a simple life. Sleeping under the stars, eating marshmallows, and taking each day one at a time without a care in the world."
"$HN2FoxleCube6": "VULTOS: Well, not quite: the Magister was here first. No one really knows his story. But, he did find me and rescue me. My escape pod landed on an uninhabited planet, and I lacked the skills for survival. I would have died, if he hadn't found me and brought me on board."
"$HN2FoxleCube8": "VULTOS: It's understandable to doubt our goal here. But it's for the good of all. We must ensure this universe does not truly die."
"$HN2FoxleSecret1": "VULTOS: It's really been 200 years since that day, huh. 200 years since...I ran like a coward."
"$HN2FoxleSecret2": "VULTOS: The Magister and Vespa always try to console me, and I know they're right. Had I stayed, I'd have died with the rest of them."
"$HN2FoxleSecret3": "VULTOS: Still, that doesn't make it hurt any less. The idea that...I didn't deserve to be rescued. I should have died on that green planet, fallen into one of the geysers and drowned."
"$HN2FoxleSecret4": "VULTOS: I hope that..."
"$HN2FoxleSecret5": "VULTOS: I should get back to work on my schematics."
"$HN2OwlkCube2": "VULTOS: Ha, you bet! I'll win one of these days!"
"$HN2RedeyeCube2": "VULTOS: This is quite a garden you've got here. I guess you have a lot of experience with plants?"
"$HN2RedeyeCube4": "VULTOS: Oh, really, why is that?"
"$HN2RedeyeCube6": "VULTOS: I see. Well, I'm glad you have a hobby you enjoy so much, and you're able to be a big help to your kind."
"$HN2RedeyeCube8": "VULTOS: Brightening up other people's days is my calling."
"$HN2Poem1": "<![CDATA[<color=#0013FF>To wash away regret, that the sun may shine brighter tomorrow.</color>]]>"
"$HN2EndF1": "Hello. It has been a long time since I met someone with your curiosity."
"$HN2EndF2": "Tell me, how does it feel to know the survival of your race hangs on your shoulders?"
"$HN2EndFA1": "I understand. I have lived with regret ever since...that day, and I do not know if I made the correct decision. But, I cannot imagine what it must be like to be perpetually stuck in a position where you must make that decision."
"$HN2EndFB1": "I am glad to hear that. I hope that you do not end up regretting your decision. I have lived with regret ever since...that day."
"$HN2EndFHNA1": "Ah, yes, you visited my homeworld. You saw how my kind destroyed themselves over petty arguments."
"$HN2EndFHNA2": "I happened to be awake when the Red Clan invaded. We were all supposed to be in cryo-pods during transit, but I snuck out."
"$HN2EndFHNA3": "When they came, I rushed to the Escape Pods, and without even thinking of trying to save anyone else, I just launched the pod. Through some miracle, the pod managed to survive long enough to reach your world."
"$HN2EndFHNA4": "Not a day goes by that I don't wonder if I made the correct decision. I feel like I should have tried to save some others, but if I had, then there is a good chance no one would have survived."
"$HN2EndFHNA5": "Do not live with regret. It consumes you. I only got through it because of my friends. Never forget those who have brought you this far."
"$HN2EndFHNB1": "In short, I made a choice to save myself, but that choice may have prevented any others from being saved."
