LILY LINES:
Lily is a Nomai, who speaks with the technical mannerisms of her kind. Her voice is analytic, but she is still very emotive.

"$HN2Chamber4": "LILY: I don't think any of us had anticipated that the Magister's message would so completely change our lives."
"$HN2EngineBattery2": "LILY: What are the spares for?"
"$HN2EngineBattery4": "LILY: Actually, I have been wondering: After we step into the Device with our batteries in hand, we're not going to be able to come back. Who is going to turn the Device off?"
"$HN2EngineBattery6": "LILY: But won't that drain all the power? The Device certainly won't function without energy."
"$HN2EngineBattery8": "LILY: Well, what about this room? Certainly all the power draw is going to cause a lot of stress on the ship. How will we know if the ship even survives until then?"
"$HN2LibraryMagi4": "LILY: Hypothesis: what we see is not even his true form, but he has taken it because it is something we can comprehend."
"$HN2Camp10": "LILY: Of course, Magister! Here, I have a pack right now."
"$HN2NomaiCube2": "LILY: You've met Nomai before?"
"$HN2NomaiCube4": "LILY: ...oh."
"$HN2NomaiCube6": "LILY: Oh, no, don't let me be a downer! Come on, you still have many others to meet! And we still need to determine what technology you can contribute to the Device."
"$HN2Poem4": "<![CDATA[<color=#8451FF>To preserve advancement, that the next generation may not suffer from our mistakes.</color>]]>"
"$HN2EndN1": "Greetings. I am Lily. I am Nomai, but you already knew all that."
"$HN2EndN2": "I do not know whether to envy you. You are potentially the ultimate explorer. You can explore anywhere without fear of consequence and death."
"$HN2EndN3": "Yet, you are also unable to truly share your discoveries. Anything you learn will be forgotten in minutes."
"$HN2EndN4": "To explore, and share our discoveries, that is the goal of the Nomai. It is why we became nomads in the first place."
"$HN2EntranceWall1": "LILY: Well... I'm here, it seems. The \"Magister\" invited me here; let's see if he's as cordial as his invitation."
"$HN2EntranceWall2": "LILY: This technology is quite advanced. The cube here that greeted me decoded my language when I arrived. Perhaps it read from my memory?"
"$HN2EntranceWall3": "LILY: Hopefully, my talents will actually be appreciated here."
"$HN2DeviceNomai": "LILY: To preserve advancement, that the next generation may not suffer from our mistakes."
"$HN2CampWall1": "LILY: It took some searching for resources, but I've managed to install a special gravity crystal here."
"$HN2CampWall2": "LILY: It projects a special kind of gravity field in the whole room, producing lighter gravity than this vessel's average further from it, and heavier gravity near it."
"$HN2CampWall3": "LILY: And, as is typical for a crystal, it requires no power, so should something happen to this vessel's gravity, we can retreat to this room."
"$HN2CampWall4": "LILY: This should be able to satisfy the various gravity requirements for us, so we can all relax in comfort together."
"$HN2HomeWall1_1": "LILY: We have a new friend today! Her name is Roja."
"$HN2HomeWall1_2": "LILY: She's a botanist, which I find very interesting. The way she sees plants must be quite unique. She's also an artist, and uses some interesting palettes."
"$HN2HomeWall1_3": "LILY: The Magister put her room right after mine, so I'm no longer at the end of the hallway."
"$HN2HomeWall1_4": "LILY: It's always quite a sight to see the Magister at work, manipulating the shape of this Vessel at will."
"$HN2HomeWall2_1": "LILY: I'm not usually one to brag, but I must say: my room looks quite a bit better than the others!"
"$HN2HomeWall2_2": "LILY: Only Vespa's room really even compares, to be honest. The others are quite...flat."
"$HN2HomeWall2_3": "LILY: I admit, surrounded by familiar architecture, I am beginning to miss home. But I know that they probably aren't missing me. And I'm part of something much bigger here, anyway."
"$HN2HomeWall3_1": "LILY: Well, having arrived here, I am quite intrigued by the Magister's proposition. To construct the Device, and ensure the memory of this universe survives..."
"$HN2HomeWall3_2": "LILY: I would love to be able to actually contribute to something important, and be appreciated. I'll be working with four others."
"$HN2HomeWall3_A1": "LILY: The leader of this vessel is an enigmatic figure who calls himself \"The Magister.\" He is quite powerful, able to manipulate this vessel at will, and can change his size...and appearance."
"$HN2HomeWall3_A2": "LILY: Normally, he keeps his appearance to be a tall, cloaked figure, with his five glowing eyes visible behind his mask. His size is immense, easily twice the size of Acquarius, who himself is about four times my own size."
"$HN2HomeWall3_A3": "LILY: Despite his immensity, though, he is very friendly and polite. When speaking with him, it's easy to forget the difference in our sizes and not be intimidated. I very much enjoy discussing complex topics with him!"
"$HN2HomeWall3_B1": "LILY: The first person to have joined the Magister's crew is a bibliophile named Vultos. He is covered in fur like myself, aside from a hard shell on his back and partially running down his forehead, and has a long, bushy tail."
"$HN2HomeWall3_B2": "LILY: He normally has quite a cheerful demeanor, and I love spending time with him. He enjoys playing games with us and cracking jokes, when he's not hiding somewhere absorbed in some volume."
"$HN2HomeWall3_B3": "LILY: Still, I sense a sadness within him. He has some deep regret, but I am reluctant to ask him about it. I am sure the opportunity will arise."
"$HN2HomeWall3_C1": "LILY: One of my fellow crewmates is a tall, feathered, and antlered individual named Vespa. She is also an inventor, much like myself!"
"$HN2HomeWall3_C2": "LILY: She loves seeing the stars, and discussing technology!"
"$HN2HomeWall3_D1": "LILY: The newest member of the crew (before me of course) is a tall, aquatic individual named Acquarius."
"$HN2HomeWall3_D2": "LILY: He's very mechanically-minded, and likes to work out. He's quite a strong hunk!"
"$HN2HomeWall3_D3": "LILY: He also likes to build little mechanisms, and he's lined his shelves with them, along with his tools."
"$HN2LibraryWall2": "LILY: You press the keys like this. It can take some practice to learn how to use a writing staff."
"$HN2LibraryWall4": "LILY: Getting closer. Here, try adjusting your typing angle."
"$HN2LibraryWall6": "LILY: One complicated topic at a time, sorry.",
"$HN2LibraryBookcase1": "LILY: I saw Vultos climbing the central pillar once. I'm not quite that athletic, but I'm hoping I can see what is up there from here.",
"$HN2LibraryBookcase2": "LILY: He is reading on top of the artificial sun! What does he need that much privacy for?"
